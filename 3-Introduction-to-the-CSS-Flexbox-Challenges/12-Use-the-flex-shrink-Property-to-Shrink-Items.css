/* I learned about flex-shrink, which applies to the flex items (children)
instead of the container (parents); shrinking the items if the container is
too small. Items shrink when the width of the parent container is smaller
than the combined widths of all the flex items within it. Flex-shrink takes
interger and floating point numbers in proportion to other flex-shrink values
(e.g value of 4 and value of 1, the item with a value of 4 shrinks 4 times as
much as the item with a value of 1). */

    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    flex-shrink: 1;

  #box-2 {
    background-color: orangered;
    width: 100%;
