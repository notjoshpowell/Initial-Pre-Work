/* I learned about flex-basis, which sets the initial size of an element,
of which CSS would make adjustments with flex-shrink and flex-grow. If the
value is set to auto, the size of items is based on the content. Flex-basis
uses the same units as other size properties (px, em, %, in, etc.)*/

<style>
  #box-container {
    display: flex;
    height: 500px;
  }

  #box-1 {
    background-color: dodgerblue;
    height: 200px;
    flex-basis: 10em;
  }

  #box-2 {
    background-color: orangered;
    height: 200px;
    flex-basis: 20em;
  }
</style>

<div id="box-container">
  <div id="box-1"></div>
  <div id="box-2"></div>
</div>
