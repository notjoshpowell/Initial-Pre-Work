/*I learned that variables can also store decimal numbers (floating point). Not all
real numbers can be accurately represented in floating point (transcendental numbers
we're looking at you) - this can lead to rounding errors. Lesson 13 touches on this
very briefly as a link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point#Accuracy_problems */

var ourDecimal = 5.7;

// Only change code below this line

var myDecimal = 3.14;
