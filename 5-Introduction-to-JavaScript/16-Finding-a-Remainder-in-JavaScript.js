/* I learned about the remainder operator %, which gives the amount of numbers
in the remainders as it's answer. e.g 12.3 would be % =1 , 12.45 would be % = 2
If there is a remainder when divided by 2, the number is odd, otherwise (if the
remainder is 0) the number is even. */

// Only change code below this line

var remainder = 11 % 3 ;
