/* I learned about compound assignments, which combine an operator with = .
In this lesson, it is the addition operator + with = , or += . The variable
is on the left += the desired number for addition.
I also learned about console.log(varName); , which is like the print function in
Python in that it shows the value of varName in the console window.*/

var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
