/* I learned about single and double quotes in JS. JS interprets the two types
the same way. The advantage to this is that if there is one type of quotation mark
within a string, the other type can be used within the string without escape characters
(backslash \). However, if there is a quotation mark inside the quotes that match the
outside quotation marks, an escape character is necessary (\).
