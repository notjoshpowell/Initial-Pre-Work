/* I learned about different sequences, which essentially allow for text elements
like new line, tab, and a few others I'm not too familiar with yet. The same rule
applies that the backslash \ proceeds the character to be escaped inside the string.
The following are examples from freeCodeCamp: \'	single quote   \"	double quote
\\	backslash   n	newline  \r	carriage return \t	tab  \b	backspace  \f	form feed */

var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine"; // Change this line
