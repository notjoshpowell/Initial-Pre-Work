/* I learned about concatenating strings which is similar to adding a string
value to another e.g var strName = "Hello " + "Goodbye"; = "Hello Goodbye"
Concatenation does not add spaces or punctuation. */

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
