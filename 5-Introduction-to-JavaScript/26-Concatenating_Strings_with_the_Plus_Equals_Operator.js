/* I learned how to "use the += operator to concatenate a string onto the end
of an existing string variable." (freeCodeCamp) This works similarly to compound
addition in lesson 17 in that a variable is called followed by += "second string"
and can be used to concatenate multiple strings */

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
