/* I learned how to build a string with variables and other string elements using
the addition operator + . The variable within a string concatenation does not need
quotation marks. */

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Josh";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
