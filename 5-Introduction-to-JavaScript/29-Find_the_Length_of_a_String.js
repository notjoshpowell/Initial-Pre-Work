/*I learned about the .length property which finds the length of a string
variable or literal(literal = "stringName".length;) .length counts the number
of characters, including spaces and symbols within a string. */

// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
