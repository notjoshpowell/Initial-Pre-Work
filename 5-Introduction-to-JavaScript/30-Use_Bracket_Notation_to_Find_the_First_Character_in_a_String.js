/*I learned about bracket notation, which returns the character that the
index (number within the bracket) is set to. Since JS starts counting at 0, 0
is considered the first character in a given string. */

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
