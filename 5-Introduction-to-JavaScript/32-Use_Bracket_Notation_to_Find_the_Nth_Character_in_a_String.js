/*I learned that bracket notation can find any position within a string.
By subtracting n-1, one can find the character they're looking for to place in the
bracket. e.g 3rd character n=3 so 3-1 = [2] .*/

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
