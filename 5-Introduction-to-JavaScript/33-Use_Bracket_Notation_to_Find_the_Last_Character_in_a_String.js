/*I learned that the last character of a string can be obtained by subracting one
from the string's length, e.g 0-1 = last. Inside of a bracket after the variable name,
retype the variableName.length - 1 */

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
